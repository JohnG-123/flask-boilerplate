h1. Flask Boilerplate Project

h2. Introduction

I wanted a quick way to create websites with all my favorite dev settings and customizations. So I created this boilerplate project based on the "Flask":http://flask.pocoo.org (Python) microwebframework.

Why is Flask-Boilerplate useful? Because you get:

# Good code defaults. For example, it uses "packages and modules":http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/packages/ by default so that controllers (and models) are split into logical groups in separate files, rather than using a monolithic file which contains everything.
# New Project script - sets up everything for you, including Apache mod_wsgi deployment!
#* NOTE: The installation script works specifically with Ubuntu Linux, Apache, mod_wsgi only.
# Deploy to a Ubuntu server with a single command (sets up everything for you, including @virtualenv@, etc.)
# jQuery - no webapp is complete without it
# Grid system, via the "960 Grid System":http://960.gs/ - so that you can get started with your UI quickly
# HTML5 goodness, via "HTML5 Boilerplate":http://html5boilerplate.com - for a good base UI

h2. Get Started

@git clone git://github.com/swaroopch/flask-boilerplate.git mynewapp@
@cd mynewapp@
@pip install Fabric@
@fab code_setup:mynewapp.com@
Write your code in @flask_application/controllers/frontend.py@
@fab serve@

When you're ready to deploy your code to a server:

@fab server_setup@ # once per server
@fab deploy@

* "Mobile user agent detection":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mobile.sniffer to redirect users to a mobile version of the website that uses the "Mobile HTML5 Boilerplate":https://github.com/shichuan/mobile-html5-boilerplate
